# AI-Powered Travel Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an AI-powered travel recommendation system that provides personalized travel suggestions based on user preferences, location, weather, and sentiment analysis. The goal is to build a **custom machine learning model** that enhances user experience through intelligent recommendations.

## Live Demo

## Features
- **Personalized Travel Suggestions:** AI-driven recommendations based on user preferences, budget, and interests.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Model:** Uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for better accuracy.
- **Location & Weather-Based Insights:** Enhances recommendations with real-time contextual factors.
- **Sentiment Analysis Integration:** Analyzes user mood to refine suggestions.
- **Interactive UI:** Modern web interface for an engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask/FastAPI
- **Database:** MongoDB (if applicable)
- **APIs:** OpenWeather API, Google Places API
- **Deployment:** Netlify (Frontend), Render/Heroku (Backend if applicable)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm
- Python (if running ML models locally)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ai-travel-recommendations
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. (Optional) If using a backend, set it up and run:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Model Development
- **Data Preprocessing:** One-hot encoding, TF-IDF for text data, normalization.
- **Model Training:** Hybrid recommendation model using collaborative and content-based filtering.
- **Performance Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, accuracy scores.
- **Optimization Strategies:** Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

## Usage
1. Visit the live demo link.
2. Enter your travel preferences.
3. View AI-generated travel recommendations.
4. Save or share recommendations with others.

## Future Enhancements
- **Chatbot Integration:** AI-based travel assistant for real-time queries.
- **Advanced Filtering:** More refined recommendations based on real-time data.
- **User Authentication:** Save travel preferences and history.
- **Scalability:** Optimize for diverse users and larger datasets.
